A very great project on images classification with keras and text tokenization to help a website to classify its products, based on these two approaches.

For the text, I essentialy use nltk with count vectorizer and n gram, coupled with a LDA. I've got some good results on clusters made, evaluated with coefficient silhouette and Davis bouldin score.

For the image, I've tried different approaches:
- One old school approach with SIFT
- One modern approach with VGG16 on Keras

It was quite interesting to develop my first convolutional neuron network and implement Transfer Learning with Keras. 

Take a look at this project, it's real, visual, data driven and nice clusering results !
